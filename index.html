                    <p>
                        As most college students are pretty busy, and let's be honest, pretty forgetful as well, students often have some challenges with remembering their keycards. One proposed solution for this issue is the use of facial recognition to replace the use of keycards.

                        Some tests were performed with real life people to determine if changes needed to be made to the design of the protototypes, that were, for arguements sake, not post-it notes on a wall.
